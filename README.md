# Rhythm Pong

This projet is a remake of my old Rhythm Pong created in July 2019.

This version is made with Unity in C# and this is my firt Unity project.

## Download Latest release
You can download the lastest release [here](https://github.com/Blackoutburst/Rhythm-Pong/releases/download/v1.0.0/Rhythm.Pong.zip). Extract the zip file, then run R Pong Unity Edition.exe **You will need a good computer to run it smoothly**

## This is not a game but a simple visual experiment, the improvement made between this version and the old Java / LWJGL one are :
- Visual improvement (Better shader, better particles effect, ball trail, ...).
- Physics improvement, now the ball can't go through player and cause some song desync.
- New component like the middle gravity making the ball curve.
- Better ghost ball calcul
- Player now unable to score point
- New sprite

## How to build
Clone this project and open it with Unity and use the Unity build feature to test it on your computer
